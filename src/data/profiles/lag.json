  "research_statement": "I develop methods to ensure trustworthy and resilient autonomous systems that interact with humans both in and on control loops. Driven by real-world stakeholders, my goal is to enable a relationship for providing mutual assurances between deep-learning-enabled cyber-physical systems and humans in safety-critical contexts.",
  "research_questions": [
    "Leveraging semantics to retrofit security and resiliency: For deployed and legacy systems, how can we leverage knowledge about a cyber-physical system's semantics, e.g., the underlying physical equations, to enhance safety and security at all levels of the software stack?",
    "Integrating Human Logic & Deep Learning for Trustworthy Autonomous Design: What are the correct ways to interface symbolic knowledge and deep learning models in cyber-physical systems that allow humans to understand and intervene decision-making processes?",
    "Secure, Private, and Useful Ubiquitous Sensing: With the explosion of IoT sensors, how can we expose useful programming abstractions to developers while ensuring secure and private cyber-physical information flow?"
